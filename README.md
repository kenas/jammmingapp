## Project Overview
React application designed to enhance the user’s interaction with Spotify’s vast music library. The application offers a seamless way to search for tracks, explore artist profiles, and view album details. Additionally, users can preview audio snippets, making music discovery engaging and intuitive. The sleek and modern design ensures a user-friendly experience, with all essential features accessible at a glance.

The core functionality revolves around creating custom playlists. Users can search for their favorite songs and add them to a playlist.

It includes validation mechanisms, such as checking for duplicate tracks in the playlist, and guides users through authentication when needed. Overall, this app bridges the gap between music discovery and playlist creation, making it a perfect tool for Spotify enthusiasts who love customizing their listening experience.
